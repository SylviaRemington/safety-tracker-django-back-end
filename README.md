- Learned how to delete a commit via (1) Looking up the commit number in git log, (2) Making sure it was the correct commit with git checkout a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0, (3) Going back into the main branch where my repo and commit were located, (4) Doing a hard reset to completely delete the commit (since that is where all the problems were arising) with git reset --hard HEAD~1, (5) Pushing this change through via git push origin main --force. Grateful to have learned this. There is also the ability to do a "soft" reset as well. Since I am working solo on this project, I double checked everything and then proceeded. If I were in a team, my actions would have taken into account other team members and I wouldn't have done it this way.
